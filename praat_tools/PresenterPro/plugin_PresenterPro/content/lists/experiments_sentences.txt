The clown had a funny face.
I didn't say big, I said pig!
I love you.
After tea, father fed the cat some food.
She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.
I didn't say pig, I said big!
The car engine's running.
You are an idiot.
I didn't say pea, I said tea!
Don't ask me to carry an oily rag like that.
I think you are beautiful.
I didn't say tea, I said pea!
Children like strawberries.
I really like you.
I didn't say key, I said tea!
The house had nine rooms.
I hate this guy.
I didn't say tea, I said key!
They're buying some bread.
You are acting like a jerk.
I didn't say key, I said pea! 
The green tomatoes are small.
I am really happy to see you.
I didn't say pea, I said key! 
I can't stand you face.
