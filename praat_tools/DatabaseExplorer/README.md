# About
DatabaseExplorer is a [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) plugin for you to intuitively inspect a folder containing speech files, cut them into snippets and save them to a different location, with just some simple clicks of your mouse.

Databases typically have many files in one directory. In Praat it can be a bit bulky to run through a file collection. The fundamental idea of databaseExplorer is that you can simply loop through a number of files in a directory and can carry out simple edits. To change from one file to the next or back, you can simply use the arrow buttons.

- Input: Sound object(s) selected in Praat object window.
- Output (optional): Sound with a TextGrid taht is saved in a directory of your choice.

# Demonstration
This short **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjlFNOzfdPo)** produced by Clemens Lutz from LiRI Resource Hub efficiently demonstrates you everything about databaseExplorer, from the installation to the usage. Be sure to ckeck it out ðŸ˜‰!

# Installation
- Method 1 (recommended): Copy the directory `./plugin_databaseExplorer` into the [Praat preferences directory](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/preferences_folder.html): \
  Assuming you're user `liri`:, \
  on Windows: `C:\Users\liri\Praat\`; \
  on MacOS: `/Users/liri/Library/Preferences/Praat Prefs/`; \
  on Linux: `/home/liri/.praat-dir/`.\
  Then reopen Praat, databaseExplorer automatically appears in Praat under â€˜New > PresenterProâ€™, in Praat Objects window.
- Method 2: Execute the script `setup.praat` thatâ€™s inside the directory. \
  **Note**: if using this method, the plugin folder should not be moved somewhere else after executing the script, otherwise it couldnâ€™t be found next time. Therefore highly recommend to use method 1.
